# CK3 Language Server

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation of the Paradox interactive scripting language for Crusader Kings 3

This project is still in progress, but I'm hoping to have a working implementation of LSP alongside a full parser for the scripting language that Paradox uses for their games.
